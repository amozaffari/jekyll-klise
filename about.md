Hi! I'm Amirpasha, a geoscience researcher 🌍 with a passion for machine learning 👾 and high-performance computing. Currently, I am working at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, focusing on improving climate scenarios and projections. At the same time, I am keeping pace with the fast-paced developments in machine learning ✨!

Nowadays, I am interested in explainable machine learning 🔍 and its application in climate and weather modeling 🌦️. In addition, I am interested in FAIR and reproducible science.
