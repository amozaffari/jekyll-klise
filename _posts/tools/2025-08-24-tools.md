*Last update: 24 Aug. 2025*

Hey all, here is my 2025 list of tools that i use regurally! You can the same list check my list for previous [year here](_posts/tools/2024-07-21-tools.md).
Here, I will keep a list of all the tools that I use and like. It might be interesting for you too. I will update this as it goes.

## Note Taking

- **Notion**: By far my most important note taking tool. I consolidate all my notes in a single place! It works perfectly with Mobile and Mac and has many integration. An all-in-one workspace for notes, tasks, databases, and collaboration, offering extensive customization. The free version is more than enough!
- **Capacities**: An easy to use note taking app that has a lot of functionality, but i am only using it for journallying. It supports integration with Whatsapp, so i can text myself everyday and it will end up in my daily notes.
- **Granola**: Extremly impressive AI-assitant note taking tool that runs on the background and can transcribe the meeting (online, or in-person) and create sharable, editable meeting note summary that are extremly healpful. It also has a seemless Notion integration that is a plus.
- **reMarkable**: *Now is collecting dust in my drawer!* ~~An overkill note-taking notepad! It works superbly, but most people probably wouldn't need it.~~

## Keeping up with information

- **gitlab**: End up using the GitLab as my to-do list and project planning platform as well, and so far it is quite okay. I am thinking to move everything to GitHub as it has a native iOS app.
- **Zotero**: *I end up upgrading to paid version.* A free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. To use it extensively, you might end up paying since the 300MB free space is quite limited. 
- **[scholar-inbox.com](https://www.scholar-inbox.com/)**: It is super useful and free to use paper recommendation systems that, based on your prior publications and list of favorite papers, monitor recently published open access papers and send a recommendation list to your inbox. You can provide easy feedback on these recommendations to refine your tailored algorithm. Now, it has been more than six months that I have been using it, mostly for meetings where it is easier to write than type. Unfortunately, there aren't many of these meetings these days.
- **[arxiv-sanity-lite.com](https://arxiv-sanity-lite.com/)**: If you dont wanna go through all the hussels of setting up scholar-inbox, this one is easier and lighter ;-).
- **Feedly**: After Omniverese was termienated, i was looking for read-later app to replace it, and i couldnt find any. End up using feedly that support RSS (that i use to follow publications and news), that also has read-it-later funtion that it is kind of working on mac, but not really support adding items on iOS. Anyway, better than nothing.
- **RainDrop.IO**: A bookmark collection that support both mac and iOS, so far i am quite happy with it. Lets see.

## macOS

- **Things**: A task management app with a simple and intuitive UX. You just buy it once, with no monthly membership fees.
- **mactop**: A productivity tool for macOS that allows you to monitor the state of your Mac in real time.

## AI

- **Gemini**: My usual coding assitant, pretty versetile and quite fast, and became my go-to app.
- **ChatGPT**: After almost 3 years, i canceled my premium subscription as i was only using it for correcting my grammer and shortern text, that Gemini is very capable.
- **Claude/ Claude Code**: I was using Claude as my personal therapist for sometimes now, but i just recently upgraded to aid version to use Claude Code on local and remote and so far it is working quite okay,...
- **NoteBookLM**: I am using this quite often, for getting overview about a paper(s) fast, to do litrature review, or even for the EML podcast, extremly useful. Paid version (combine with Google one) is a worthy tool.

## Coding

- **Wrap**: A versatile tool for code wrapping, ensuring clean and readable code formatting across different programming languages.
