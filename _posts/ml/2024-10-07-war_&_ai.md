I have contributed to the following snippit of text, which was part of longer read that was published in **BSC Earth Science Equity Newsletter** in March 2024 and is also available [here](https://earth.bsc.es/wiki/doku.php?id=working_groups:equity4es:debate_of_the_month).

## War and AI

The role of science and new technologies should also be considered when discussing the impacts of war on society and on social inequity. In particular, AI (Artificial Intelligence) is increasingly being developed and adapted for military purposes, where its capabilities are being harnessed for autonomous targeting and engagement systems.

These developments raise significant ethical, legal, and security concerns, primarily because these systems can make lethal decisions without human intervention [15, 16]. The issue is further magnified by the fact that while these autonomous systems are programmed to follow rules strictly, they cannot make moral judgments, even when the laws of war themselves might be ethically questionable.

Such autonomous systems are already being developed and tested in military applications, transforming modern warfare [17]. Examples include robots with automatic machine guns featuring target recognition and engagement capabilities [18], autonomous UAV drones, robot dogs carrying machine guns and explosives [19], AI-controlled machine guns used in assassinations [20], and Israel's deployment of AI-based rapid target identification systems in the Gaza Strip [21, 22].

The ethical and legal complexities of AI in warfare demand a robust international framework focused on accountability, meaningful human oversight, and responsible development of autonomous weapons systems (AWS) [23]. The scientific community must play an active role in these discussions, as researchers and developers are essential contributors and enablers of this expanding application of AI. Many researchers at the forefront of these advancements are concerned and actively sharing their worries [24, 25].

Our expertise is vital to ensure these weapons are developed with clear ethical guidelines and rigorous safeguards.Through international collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and ethicists, and with adequate vigilance, we can ensure AI technologies are deployed responsibly and ethically, balancing innovation with global peace and security imperatives.
