My growing list of problem solving and rule bending nature of hacking. Inspired by [@jadi](https://twitter.com/jadi) hacker rules.
This list will grow as i test and refine these principals.

* **Gall’s Law:** "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."
* **Shirky Principle:** "Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution."
* **Pareto Principle:** "Roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes."
* **Murphy’s Law:** "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."
* **Linus’s Law:** "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
* **Parkinson’s Law:** "Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."
* **Amdahl’s Law:** "The speedup of a program from parallelization is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program."
* **Postel’s Law:** "Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others."
